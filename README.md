# Beijing AQI 2015-2017

I created this project to demonstrate how I use multiple Python libraries on a Jupyter Notebook.

To successfully run the code on my machine, I had to fix [a issue related to arm64 macOS](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/5872).

This project uses three datasets from [StateAir](http://www.stateair.net/), an U.S. Department of State Air Quality Monitoring Program.

- [Beijing_2016_HourlyPM25_created20170201.csv](http://www.stateair.net/web/assets/historical/1/Beijing_2016_HourlyPM25_created20170201.csv)

Since I recently start learning Python and Data Analysis, I have many difficulities to write code in a simple and efficient way. Please feel free to offer any modifications and suggestions.
