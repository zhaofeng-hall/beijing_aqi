# Beijing AQI

I created this project to demonstrate how I use multiple Python libraries on a Jupyter Notebook.

To successfully run the code on my machine, I had to fix [a issue related to arm64 macOS](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/5872).

This project uses datasets from [StateAir](http://www.stateair.net/), an U.S. Department of State Air Quality Monitoring Program.

Note: These datasets are observational data and are not fully verified or validated.

The project follows State Air's guidelines.

Since I recently start learning Python and Data Analysis, I have many difficulities to write code in a simple and efficient way. Please feel free to improve codes.

I will switch to VS Studio Code to integrate with git flow after the term assessment.
